Menu Home About graph node similarity Measuring Graph similarity using Neighbor Matching Posted on September 19, 2014September 20, 2014 by Dulanga Sashika Graphs are very important in present applications because many data structures in real world problems are represented as graphs. Examples vary from the web graph of documents to a social network graph of friends and road map graph of cities. Many of these applications call for a quantitative measure of the “similarity” of two graphs. There are many researches going on this topic and many people introduce various techniques to measure the similarity. In here, I am going to talk about one technique that use neighbor matching to measure the similarity score of the two directed graphs. I am going to demonstrate this algorithm using a java code that I implemented. This algorithm is based on the research paper, “Measuring Similarity of Graph Nodes by Neighbor Matching”[1]. The algorithm that mentioned in this paper is based on a simple concept that, two nodes i ∈ VA and j ∈ VB are considered to be similar if neighbor nodes of i can be matched to similar neighbor nodes of j.
