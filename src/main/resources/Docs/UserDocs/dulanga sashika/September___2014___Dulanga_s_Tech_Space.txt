Menu Home About Month: September 2014 Configure a JMS queue in standalone.xml of JBoss AS7 Posted on September 20, 2014September 20, 2014 by Dulanga Sashika Today I am going show how we can configure JMS queue support in standalone.xml of JBoss AS7. Actually in earlier versions of JBoss, JMS configuration was in the standalone.xml file. But in JBoss AS7 and after versions, all the JMS queue configurations are in standalone-full.xml and standalone-ha.xml files and removed from other files. When we start the server with default configurations, it will run the standalone.xml file. If we want to setup a queue in the server, we have to configure it in standalone-full.xml file and start the server with that file like follow.  For Linux:  JBOSS_HOME_SERVER_1/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
 For Windows:  JBOSS_HOME_SERVER_1\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml But we may need to keep the default configurations and start the server with that. Therefore we need to add queue configurations into that standalone.xml file. Continue reading → Share this: Twitter1 Facebook Google LinkedIn Like this: Like Loading...

Examples vary from the web graph of documents to a social network graph of friends and road map graph of cities. Many of these applications call for a quantitative measure of the “similarity” of two graphs. There are many researches going on this topic and many people introduce various techniques to measure the similarity. In here, I am going to talk about one technique that use neighbor matching to measure the similarity score of the two directed graphs. I am going to demonstrate this algorithm using a java code that I implemented. This algorithm is based on the research paper, “Measuring Similarity of Graph Nodes by Neighbor Matching”[1]. The algorithm that mentioned in this paper is based on a simple concept that, two nodes i ∈ VA and j ∈ VB are considered to be similar if neighbor nodes of i can be matched to similar neighbor nodes of j.
