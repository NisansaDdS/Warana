From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search For more information, see Category:Video game development software Editing a sprite in Shoot'Em-Up Construction Kit A Game Creation System (GCS) is a consumer-targeted integrated development environment such as Novashell[1] or Pie in the Sky,[2] consisting of a set of specialized design tools (and sometimes a light scripting language), engineered for the rapid iteration of user-derived videogames. Game creation systems promise an easy entry point for novice game designers, with often little to no coding required for simple behaviors. Although initially stigmatized, all-in-one game creation systems have gained some legitimacy with the central role of Game Maker in the growth of the indie game development community.[3] Currently the Independent Games Festival recognizes games produced with Game Maker and similar platforms.

Most of these early design frameworks are specific to one or another genre. A few reached fairly wide acceptance; users like Ray Larabie made a name for themselves through SEUCK-originated games. As the IBM-based PC gained dominance in the 1990s, game creation systems shifted both to the more general and the more specific. Whereas frameworks like RSD Game-Maker and Klik & Play attempted to accommodate any genre, communities grew around games like ZZT (later, MegaZeux[6]) that permitted such extensive user modification that they essentially became de facto game creation systems. Later in the mid-2000s, with the growth of the World Wide Web and social networking, programs like BlitzBasic and Multimedia Fusion headlined an explosion of interest both in indie games and in canned game design software.[citation needed] Whereas earlier game creation systems tend to err on the side of user friendly interfaces,[7] 21st-century systems are often distinguished by extensive scripting languages that attempt to account for every possible user variable.[citation needed] Scripting languages[edit] The rise of game creation systems also saw a rise in the need for free form scripting languages with general purpose use. One such case is the engine used for Jak and Daxter and Grand Theft Auto III. Some packages, such as Blender Game Engine and Conitec's Gamestudio, include a more comprehensive scripting language under the surface to allow users more leeway in defining their games' behavior. The Unity game engine includes multiple scripting languages including JavaScript, C#, and Boo (a Python-inspired language for the CLI).[8] Indie Movement[edit] Today there exists many different programs for independent video game development including BlitzBasic, Construct, Unity (game engine) among others. Tools[edit] Several game creation systems include some of the following tools. Integrated Development Environment: for managing projects and resources Command Line Interface: for compiling and debugging games Sprite Editor: for the editing of animated images commonly refereed to as sprites Model Editor: for 3D modeling purposes Map/Scene Editor: generally used for object and tile placement Genres[edit] While most of the mainstream and popular game creation systems may be general purpose, several exist solely for specific genres.
