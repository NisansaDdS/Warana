As of November 3, 2014, Android 4.4 "KitKat" is the most widely used Android version, operating on around 30.2% of Android devices worldwide. At the same time, all Android "Jelly Bean" versions (4.1–4.3.1) combined are on 50.9% of Android devices worldwide. The version history of the Android mobile operating system began with the release of the Android beta in November 2007. The first commercial version, Android 1.0, was released in September 2008. Android is under ongoing development by Google and the Open Handset Alliance (OHA), and has seen a number of updates to its base operating system since its initial release. Since April 2009, Android versions have been developed under a confectionery-themed code name and released in alphabetical order; the exceptions are versions 1.0 and 1.1 as they were not released under specific code names: Aestro (1.0) Blender (1.1) Cupcake (1.5) Donut (1.6) Eclair (2.0–2.1) Froyo (2.2–2.2.3) Gingerbread (2.3–2.3.7) Honeycomb (3.0–3.2.6) Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0–4.0.4) Jelly Bean (4.1–4.3.1) KitKat (4.4–4.4.4) Lollipop (5.0–5.0.1) On September 3, 2013, Google announced that one billion activated devices now use the Android OS worldwide.[1] The most recent major Android update was Lollipop 5.0, which was released on November 3, 2014 along with the Nexus 6 smartphone, Nexus 9 tablet, and Nexus Player set-top box.

Its source code was made available on November 3, 2014.[153][154] Lollipop brings a redesigned user interface built around a responsive design language referred to as "material design". Other changes include improvements to the notifications, which can be accessed from the lockscreen and displayed within applications as top-of-the-screen banners. Google also made internal changes to the platform, with the Android Runtime (ART) officially replacing Dalvik for improved application performance, and with changes intended to improve and optimize battery usage, known internally as Project Volta.[155][156][157][158] Version Release date Features Image(s) 5.0[159] November 12, 2014[160] Android Runtime (ART) with ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and improved garbage collection (GC), replacing Dalvik that uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation[159] Support for 64-bit CPUs OpenGL ES 3.1 and Android Extension Pack (AEP) on supported GPU configurations Recent activities screen with tasks instead of applications, up to a configured maximum of tasks per application Vector drawables, which scale without losing definition Support for print previews Material design style, bringing improvements to user interface Refreshed lock screen Refreshed notification tray and quick settings pull-down Project Volta, for battery life improvements Search inside the device settings Guest logins and multiple user accounts are available on more devices, such as phones.[161] Audio input and output through USB devices Third-party applications regain the ability to read and modify data located anywhere on external storage, such as on SD cards.[162][163] Pinning of an application's screen for restricted user activity.[164] Recently used applications are remembered even after restarting the device.[164] WebViews receive updates independently through Google Play for security reasons, instead of relying on system-wide vendor updates[165] Addition of 15 new languages: Basque, Bengali, Burmese, Chinese (Hong Kong), Galician, Icelandic, Kannada, Kyrgyz, Macedonian, Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Sinhala, Tamil and Telugu[166] This section may require copy-editing for the part below.

Both 64-bit and 32-bit variants of all three architectures are supported since the release of Android 5.0;[168] unofficial Android-x86 project had provided support for the x86 and MIPS architectures ahead of the official support.[169][170] Since 2012, Android devices with Intel processors began to appear, including phones[171] and tablets. While gaining support for 64-bit platforms, Android was first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on ARM64. Minimum hardware requirements have been upgraded in steps over time, with the new Android version releases. Original minimums were 32 MB of RAM (but less than 128 MB was not recommended,[172] with first phone HTC Dream ("flagship") phone using 192 MB), 32 MB of Flash memory, and a 200 MHz ARM architecture (ARMv5) processor.[173][174] As of November 2013[update] and Android version 4.4, builds for ARM-based devices require an ARMv7 processor (Android 5.0 also supports ARMv8-A), while recommended minimum amount of RAM is 512 MB.[126] The required minimum amount of RAM available to Android 4.4 is 340 MB (this amount does not include memory dedicated to various hardware components such as the baseband processor), and all devices with less than 512 MB of RAM must report themselves as "low RAM" devices.[127] As of October 2011[update] and Android 4.0, a graphics processing unit (GPU) that supports OpenGL ES 2.0 (and ES 1.0) hardware acceleration is mandatory,[175] regardless of whether applications directly use the OpenGL ES or not. Later, Android 4.3 added support for OpenGL ES 3.0; if used, support for both older versions (ES 2.0 and 1.0) is still mandatory.[175] In addition to running directly on x86-based hardware, Android can also be run on x86 architecture by using an Android emulator which is part of the Android SDK, or by using BlueStacks or Andy.[176][177] See also[edit] BlackBerry 10 version history Chrome OS Fire OS Firefox OS version history iOS version history Palm OS version history Symbian version history Tizen version history Windows Phone version history References[edit] ^ "Android device activation numbers reach 1 billion worldwide".
