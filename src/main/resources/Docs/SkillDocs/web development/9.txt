From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search A web design program is a computer program used to create, edit, and update web pages and websites. The purpose of such a program is to make it easier for the designer to work with page and site elements through a graphical user interface that displays the desired results, typically in a WYSIWYG manner, while removing the need for the designer to have to work with the actual code that produces those results (which includes HTML or XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, and others). Examples of a web design program include iWeb, Microsoft FrontPage, Adobe Dreamweaver and NetObjects Fusion which are commercial programs, and Amaya, which is an open source program. Many programs, such as Microsoft Word that are not dedicated to web design also have the ability to function as a web design package See also[edit] Web design v t e HTML editors Web design Web design program Open source ActiveState Komodo Amaya Aptana Arachnophilia Atom Bluefish Brackets Eclipse HTML Tidy NetBeans Quanta Plus TextMate Mozilla Composer-based BlueGriffon KompoZer SeaMonkey Composer Scintilla-based FlashDevelop Geany Notepad++ Notepad2 Programmer's Notepad gPHPedit SciTE Web-based Aloha Editor CKEditor Maqetta OpenBEXI TinyMCE VisualEditor WYMeditor YUI Rich Text Editor Freeware FirstPage Google Web Designer HTML-Kit Microsoft Visual Web Developer Microsoft SharePoint Designer Microsoft WebMatrix openElement PSPad TED Notepad TextWrangler Commercial software Cross-platform Adobe Contribute Adobe Dreamweaver Macaw Web Editor PhpStorm Sublime Text UltraEdit OS X only Coda BBEdit Freeway RapidWeaver Sandvox Site Studio skEdit Smultron Windows only CoffeeCup HTML Editor CSE HTML Validator CSSTidy EditPlus EmEditor EZGenerator NetObjects Fusion NoteTab PHPEdit TextPad TopStyle Web Architect Xara Web Designer Web-based Textbox.io Discontinued Adobe GoLive Adobe PageMill Alleycode HTML Editor AOLpress Arena Claris Home Page ConTEXT FrameGang Frame-IT! iWeb HomeSite HotDog HoTMetaL Microsoft Expression Web Microsoft FrontPage Netscape Composer Nvu Nexus (WorldWideWeb) Tkhtml tkWWW Category Comparison of early HTML editors List This article related to a type of software is a stub.
