From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Wikimedia Commons has media related to Software engineering. Software engineering is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of engineering to software. The main article for this category is Software engineering. See Category:Systems engineering for such topics as: Requirements analysis, Systems analysis, Systems architecture, System life cycle, and many more. Pages in this category should be moved to subcategories where applicable. This category may require frequent maintenance to avoid becoming too large. It should directly contain very few, if any, articles and should mainly contain subcategories. Subcategories This category has the following 23 subcategories, out of 23 total.
