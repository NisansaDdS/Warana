(September 2013) Rox Odometry SDK[20] is a multi-platform (desktops and mobiles) software that allows the users to build Augmented Reality applications. Vision-based object recognition from a database can be performed on the device or in the cloud using markers or natural features. Vision-based real-time tracking and 3D localization can be enhanced by fusing measurements from inertial and vision sensors. ARPA SDK & ARPA Plugin Unity[21] allow you to develop your own desktop, web and mobile augmented reality projects Xloudia[22] is an image recognition and image tracking solution based on cloud and video frame analysis.[citation needed] Xloudia targets the B2B market with large scale capabilities and rich features namely statistics, natural feature recognition, 3D tracking, face and colour identification for Android, and iOS. Xloudia also comes as a white brand or for "operators" under their own brand. Catchoom SDK[23] allows users to integrate image recognition & 3-D object recognition[24] and Augmented Reality experiences[25] into all native third-party applications for Android and iOS. metaio SDK offers free natural features tracking and 3D tracking that is available for Android, iOS and Microsoft Windows.[26][27] PointCloud SDK is a Software Development Kit from 13th Labs for creating augmented reality applications for iOS devices, offering simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).[28][29] Vuforia Augmented Reality SDK, formerly known as QCAR, is a Software Development Kit for creating augmented reality applications for mobile devices.[30][31] VYZAR is a cross-platform SDK for iOS and Android, with both an Augmented Reality and 3D engine[32][33] Wikitude The Wikitude SDK is a library which can be embedded in native third party application Android, BlackBerry 10 and iOS, which uses web technologies to create the Augmented Reality content.[34] AR content management systems[edit] metaio Creator, a desktop tool to create and publish AR scenarios.[35][36] buildAR.com, a web based content platform for building geolocation and natural feature tracking based mobile augmented reality.[37][38] Catchoom CraftAR,[39] a web based content management system to create Augmented Reality experiences coupled with Cloud Image Recognition.[40][41] Hoppala Augmentation, a web based content platform for creating geolocation based mobile augmented reality.[42][43] Webcam Social Shopper, web based software for integrating apparel visualization on e-commerce sites.

The majority of AR software uses special cards which are read by the device to pinpoint where the graphics will form. AR Games, a pre-loaded app on the Nintendo 3DS gaming console consisting of numerous AR games. Batman: Arkham City Cool Stacks, a game developed by Marxent Labs for Speedway LLC, is an integration of an augmented reality game into a consumer loyalty application.[59] Cybergeneration, a table top role-playing game by R. Talsorian, includes "virtuality", an augmented reality created through v-trodes, cheap, widely available devices people wear at their temples. Dead Space, a video game in which a RIG worn by Isaac Clarke is thoroughly equipped with augmented reality technology, including a navigation system that projects a line along the best route to his destination, and a system that displays images, video and text in front of him. In conjunction with the game, an augmented-reality website called No Known Survivors was released in 2008. Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA F, a video game in which an option named AR Mode allows the console to project Hatsune Miku onto a Fiduciary marker. This enable her to sing as an Augmented Reality Vocaloid Hydrophobia a survival-adventure video game from Dark Energy Digital features the MAVI (Mobile Automated Visual Interface), which is a tool used to enhance environmental geometry among other purposes.
